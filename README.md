## Features that need to be updated in the next version

In fact, most of these scripts are independent of the GTA Online update version. However, there are some features that should be updated in the future when GTA Online is updated.

- Switch CEO/President
- Instant Hack
- Dispatch Work Cooldown
- Auto-Fill Low Supplies
- Instant Collect Crates
- Fill Warehouse/Hangar Staff Sourced
- All Instant Sell
- Shipment Type Sell
- Remove Self Bounty


> [!Note:]
> Some of these features are experimental and may not work.


> [!Note:]
> I set all sales businesses with a maximum profit of 2x. I hope this method is safe because it is not excessive and there are many options for making money from the business. Because based on my experience, some of my accounts have recently been banned because I exceeded the very large sales limit and used the instant money addition option.
