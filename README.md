## Features that need to be updated in the next version

In fact, most of these scripts are independent of the GTA Online update version. However, there are some features that should be updated in the future when GTA Online is updated.

- Instant Hack/Mini Games
- Cooldowns | Dispatch Work
- Controls | Auto-Fill Low Supplies
- Controls | Enable Warehouse Auto
- Resupply | Instant Collect Crates
- Selling | All Shipment Type Sell
- Selling | All Instant Sell
- Misc | Remove Self Bounty


> [!Note:]
> Please note, some features are experimental and may not work as expected.


> [!Note:]
> For safety reasons, I've limited all business sales to a 2x profit cap to avoid detection. Based on past experience, exceeding large sales limits or using instant money options has resulted in bans.
